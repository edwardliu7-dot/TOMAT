# Multi-stage production build for GuruEOB5.
#
# Stage 1 ("build") has all the heavy tooling (pnpm, TypeScript, Vite,
# esbuild, devDependencies) needed to compile the app.
# Stage 2 ("runtime") is a slim image that only contains the compiled
# output — no source code, no node_modules, no dev tools. This keeps the
# final image small, which matters a lot on a small-RAM VPS: Docker can run
# out of memory while exporting a bloated single-stage image.
#
# esbuild bundles virtually everything into dist/index.mjs.  The one
# exception is pdfkit: it loads its built-in .afm font files from disk at
# runtime using paths relative to its own package directory, so bundling
# breaks those paths. We install pdfkit directly in the runtime stage via a
# plain npm install — it's ~5 MB and avoids the RAM-heavy `pnpm deploy` step
# that was previously needed to copy external deps.
